# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please note that while this is a
public repository, this project is primarily a learning experience and thus
outside contributions to development are not currently accepted*. However, you
are welcome to contribute in other ways such as:

 - Reporting bugs, issues, or other unintentional behavior discovered on
   [https://ufssd.org](https://ufssd.org), especially for browser compatibility.
 - Suggesting features/improvements to our website, which should first go
   through current SSD officers prior to any development discussion.

> *Following the conclusion of the project, this repository will be opened up to
> development contributions for ongoing maintenance and improvements.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/5SyB3yx).
